# Hostel-Management-System
The purpose of the Student Housing System is to deliver efficient software developed for managing various activities and operations in a hostel. The average age of an Indian is around 27 years which means that many of them are studying in various colleges to enter the workforce. For the past few years, the number of educational institutions in India has increased rapidly. Therefore, the number of hostels has also increased to accommodate students studying in their respective institutions. Hence, running the hostel for the person in charge is a cumbersome process. This particular project will deal with the problem of managing a hostel and avoid the problems which would occur if carried out manually.<br>
Student Housing System is a customized and user-friendly software for hostels that provide Hostel information, Hostel room information, and Hostel accounts information. It helps the administrator to manage Student records, staff records & generating a report of students, etc.!
